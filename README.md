# Candy-Store
This was a class project for my Intro to Python class. It is a pretty simple program that tells the unit price and total price based on weight of a product in pounds and ounces. Also, my first computer program using Python ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ’¯ ðŸ˜Ž.

Here are a couple of examples of the output that this program generates:

Example 1

Enter the candy name:Gummy Bears
Enter price per pound:1.29
Enter number of pounds:2
Enter number of ounces:3
Name of Item: Gummy Bears
Unit Price: $ 0.080625
Total Price: $ 2.821875

Example 2

Enter the candy name:Malt Balls
Enter price per pound:5.39
Enter number of pounds:3
Enter number of ounces:4
Name of Item: Malt Balls
Unit Price: $ 0.336875
Total Price: $ 17.5175
